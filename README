Simple Interactive Novel Engine

All the game data is statically built during compile time via the data.h header file

eventually if I have the time and movtivation I might add visual novel support but for now its terminal based only

currently only 92 sloc

requirements
- A C99 compliant compiler
- UNIX system (have not tested with pdcurses)
- Ncurses and Menu helper library
